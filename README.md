# FrequentItemsetsSON
Implementing SON Algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework. 
Developed a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, 
one simulated dataset and one real-world generated dataset. 
The goal is to apply the algorithms (SON and Apriori) on 
large datasets more efficiently in a distributed environment
